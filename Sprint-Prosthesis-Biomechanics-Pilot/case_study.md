# Sprint Prosthesis Biomechanics Pilot Study

## Overview
A pilot study comparing sprint acceleration in a unilateral transtibial amputee using a running-specific prosthesis against an able-bodied control. The goal was to see how the prosthesis changes loading, muscle activation, and joint movement during stance. Completed as part of graduate biomechanics coursework (KIN 6016).

## Data
Five sprint trials from one amputee participant and five from one able-bodied participant, collected by my lab group. Each trial includes ground reaction force (AMTI force plates), EMG (Delsys), and lower-limb joint kinematics (Theia3D markerless motion capture), exported through Visual3D. Left stance is the intact limb and right stance is the prosthetic limb.

## Methods
- Parsed the exported files in Python (pandas, NumPy) and time-normalized each stance phase to 101 points
- Compared the two participants' time-series curves across stance with a two-sample SPM t-test (spm1d, two-tailed, α = 0.05) for left and right ground reaction force and for gastrocnemius, hamstring, and quadriceps EMG
- Compared peak joint angles (hip flexion and extension, knee flexion, ankle plantar and dorsiflexion) with independent t-tests and boxplots

## Findings
**Intact limb (left)**
- Peak hip flexion and knee flexion were lower than the able-bodied participant (hip p < 0.001, knee p = 0.027), a stiffer movement strategy
- Vertical ground reaction force was higher in mid-stance (about 30-55% of stance)
- Hamstring EMG was higher in early stance, and gastrocnemius and quadriceps EMG were higher in the second half of stance

**Prosthetic limb (right)**
- Peak vertical force came later in stance (the last 20%), consistent with the spring-like return of the prosthesis
- Hamstring EMG was higher at initial contact and quadriceps EMG was higher in mid-stance
- Peak knee flexion was higher than the able-bodied participant (p = 0.002)

Overall, the intact limb acted as the main stabilizing and propulsive limb while the prosthetic limb relied on delayed elastic energy return.

## Limitations
This is a pilot with one participant per group and five trials each. The statistics treat trials as independent samples from one person, so the results describe these two participants and shouldn't be generalized to other sprinters or prosthesis users.
